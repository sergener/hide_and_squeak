# Hide and Squeak

A console log app created in Week 3 of Phase 1 of Devbootcamp's immersive full-stack web development program, as part of a mini-hackathon. We were given three hours to come up with an idea, program, and present it to a group of our peers. It was our first time utilizing an external API in a project.

This app uses the [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) dataset containing information on rat inspections, parsed to search for zip code and then to identify how many inspections within that zip code resulted in active rat signs, problem conditions, bait applied.

Enter your NYC zip code to find out just how rat-infested your area is.

## How to Use
1. Clone repository locally
2. In your command line, run runner.rb
